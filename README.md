# Basys3Verilog
Xilinx Vivado Veilog Codes for Real Digital Boolean Board Chapters (The board we used in laboratory is Basys 3 instead of boolean board).

All chapters and tasks inside chapters are given in the file names. 

File Name Format: verilog-challenge(if the task belongs to challenge part)-chapternumber-tasknumber-submodulename(if there is).v

Also constraint files have the same file name format: verilog-chapternumber-tasknumber.xdc

Extra for Chapter 5: I did task 3 as well but i changed it in order to complete challenge. 
If you want to do task 3, all you just have to do is remove the clock related codes and replace them with button input.
